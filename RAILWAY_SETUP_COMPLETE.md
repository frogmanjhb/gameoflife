## 📊 Expected Costs

### Hobby Plan
- **Monthly credit**: $5
- **Typical usage**: ~$4/month
- **Breakdown**:
  - Backend: ~$2.50/month
  - Frontend: ~$1.00/month
  - Database: ~$0.50/month

### Usage Calculator
- ~30 students using app daily
- ~100 requests per day
- ~1GB data storage
- Result: Well under $5/month

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Verify package.json scripts
# Ensure all dependencies are listed
```

### Cannot Connect to Database
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set
# Check PostgreSQL service is running
# Ensure schema is initialized
```

### CORS Errors
```bash
# Update CLIENT_URL in backend
# Verify frontend URL is correct
# Check browser console for actual origin
```

### 500 Internal Server Error
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --service gameoflife-backend
# Look for stack traces
```
