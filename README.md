1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Project"** ‚Üí **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Select your `gameoflife` repository
4. Click **"New"** ‚Üí **"Database"** ‚Üí **"Add PostgreSQL"**

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Database Schema
**Method 1 - Railway Dashboard (Recommended):**
1. Click on the **PostgreSQL** service

railway link

# Import schema
railway run --service backend psql < server/src/database/schema-postgres.sql
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Backend
1. In Railway, click **"New"** ‚Üí **"GitHub Repo"**
2. Select your repository
3. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys
4. Add environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
   - `JWT_SECRET` = `your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this`
   - `DATABASE_URL` = (auto-populated from PostgreSQL service)

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment
1. **Get your Railway URL** from the deployed service
2. **Update CORS settings** in Railway dashboard if needed
3. **Test the API** at `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`

### ü™ü Windows-Specific Instructions

**PowerShell Commands:**
```powershell
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Link project
railway link

# Import schema (Windows method)
Get-Content server/src/database/schema-postgres.sql | railway run --service backend psql

# Or use the dashboard method (recommended)
```

**Database Schema Import (Windows):**
1. Open Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Postgres ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Query
2. Copy contents of `server/src/database/schema-postgres.sql`
3. Paste and execute in Railway's query interface

### Environment Variables

#### Backend (Railway)
```env
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (auto-populated)
CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
```

#### Frontend (if deploying separately)
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app

```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **Database Connection**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. **CORS Errors**: Check `CLIENT_URL` matches your frontend domain
3. **Build Failures**: Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
4. **Schema Import**: Use Railway dashboard method for Windows users

#### Logs:
```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# View specific service logs
railway logs --service backend
```
