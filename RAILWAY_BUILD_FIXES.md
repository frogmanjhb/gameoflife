# ðŸ”§ Railway Build Fixes Applied

## Problem
Railway build was failing with:
```
sh: 1: tsc: Permission denied
exit code: 127
```

## Root Cause
Railway runs npm in production mode (`--production` flag), which:
- Skips `devDependencies` installation
- Caused `tsc` and `copyfiles` to be unavailable during build
- Created permission issues with cached node_modules

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Moved Build Tools to Dependencies
**File: `server/package.json`**
- âœ… Moved `typescript` from devDependencies to dependencies
- âœ… Moved `copyfiles` from devDependencies to dependencies
- âœ… Changed build script to use direct paths: `node_modules/.bin/tsc`

```json
"dependencies": {
  "typescript": "^5.3.3",
  "copyfiles": "^2.4.1",
  ...
}
```

### 2. Updated Build Scripts
**File: `server/package.json`**
```json
"build": "node_modules/.bin/tsc && node_modules/.bin/copyfiles src/database/*.sql dist/database/ --flat"
```

### 3. Updated Nixpacks Configuration
**File: `nixpacks.toml`**
- âœ… Added `--include=dev` flag to force dev dependencies installation
- âœ… Explicit install commands before build

```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install --include=dev"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["npm run install:all", "npm run build"]
```

### 4. Updated Railway Configuration
**File: `railway.toml`**
- âœ… Added explicit dev dependencies installation in buildCommand

```toml
buildCommand = "npm install --include=dev && npm run install:all && npm run build"
```

## Expected Result

Now Railway will:
1. âœ… Install all dependencies including TypeScript
2. âœ… Build backend successfully with `tsc`
3. âœ… Build frontend successfully
4. âœ… Copy SQL schema files
5. âœ… Start the server serving both frontend and backend

## Verification

Once deployed, check:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://web-production-e3a68.up.railway.app/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}
```

## Deployment Status
